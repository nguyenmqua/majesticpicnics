          <p>
          My name is Hana and Iâ€™m based in Denver, Colorado. I recently discovered my passion for arranging luxury picnics and decorations after doing one for my dearest friend. I took into consideration making it more accessible for anyone so they too can have the ability to create a special memory for their loved ones. I want to thank you for supporting me in the beginning of my new journey.
