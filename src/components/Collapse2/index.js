             My cancellation policy is that the 50% deposit will be non-refundable due to the fact that I plan every picnic accordingly and at times I have to purchase certain items that may not be available on sight. Majestic Picnics is not responsible for refunding the full amount of deposit.
            </p>{" "}

              {" "}
              A 50% deposit is required to secure the date and the full amount must be paid upon arrival. I cannot guarantee a spot if the deposit hasnâ€™t been made. 
            </p>
            <p>
              
The picnic is held for 2 hours. If you surpass the hour there will be an additional $40 fee.
